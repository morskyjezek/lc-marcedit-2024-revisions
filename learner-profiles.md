### Metadata Librarian in Training

Metadata librarian in training. Revisions to this lesson in March 2024 were based
on the idea that the target audience for this workshop would be an early career
library and information science student who intends to pursue (or explore) a career
in research libraries or archives, with a strong interest in metadata,
digital preservation, and digital content management. The learner would have some
foundation in understanding programming, knowledge management, and basics of digital
content management. In addition, the learner would have a general understanding of
resource description, such as what a "MaRC Record" is and how one may function in
a repository context.
